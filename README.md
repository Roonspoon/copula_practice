copula.practice.R \
This is the example code from: \
http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.jp/2016/03/how-to-fit-copula-model-in-r-heavily.html\
but I have added comments as an exercise to help me understand what is going on and so that \
future me will hopefully be able to understand too. \
\
So far I have only gone through part 1, part 2 will require example data provided(?) on the website.\
I also am so far not yet saving the plots within as they are trivial to reproduce quickly.\
\
\
Takeuchi2010.R\
This is a collection of my attempts to reproduce the plots from Takeuchi (2010).\
First, the Frechet-Hoeffding lower and upper bounds for copulas:\
So far I have produced 2D contour plots for the lower and upper bounds, these are named\
\'lowerBoundFH.png\' and \'upperBoundFH.png\' respectively, and are kept within the Figures folder within this directory.
